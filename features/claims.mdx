## Land Protection System

MCWeb uses an advanced land claiming system to protect your builds from griefing and theft. Learn how to claim land, manage permissions, and keep your creations safe.

## 🏠 Getting Started with Claims

### Your First Claim
New players get their first claim automatically:
- Build something (place blocks, chests, etc.)
- A small area around your build is automatically protected
- This prevents other players from building or breaking blocks

### Manual Claiming
For more control over your protected areas:

1. **Stand in the area** you want to claim
2. **Use the claim tool:** `/kit claim` gives you a golden shovel
3. **Right-click two corners** to define your claim area
4. **Confirm the claim** with `/claim`

## 🛠️ Claim Tools & Commands

### Essential Commands
- `/claim` - Create a claim in your current area
- `/abandonclaim` - Remove the claim you're standing in
- `/claimlist` - View all your claims
- `/claiminfo` - Get details about the claim you're in

### Claim Tool (Golden Shovel)
- **Right-click corners** to select claim area
- **Right-click air** to see claim boundaries
- **Shift + right-click** to subdivide claims

### Visual Indicators
- **Gold blocks** mark claim corners
- **Glowstone** marks subdivided areas
- **Particles** show claim boundaries

## 👥 Trust & Permissions

### Trusting Players
Allow others to build in your claims:

**Trust Levels:**
- `/trust <player>` - Full building permissions
- `/containertrust <player>` - Access chests and containers
- `/accesstrust <player>` - Use buttons, levers, doors
- `/permissiontrust <player>` - Can trust others (be careful!)

### Removing Trust
- `/untrust <player>` - Remove all permissions
- `/trustlist` - See who you've trusted

### Public Claims
- `/claimflag public true` - Allow anyone to build
- `/claimflag public false` - Make claim private again

## 📏 Claim Size & Limits

### Claim Blocks
Every player earns "claim blocks" over time:
- **Starting blocks:** 100 blocks
- **Hourly gain:** 120 blocks per hour played
- **Maximum:** 80,000 blocks total

### Claim Sizes
- **Minimum size:** 10x10 blocks
- **Maximum size:** Limited by your claim blocks
- **Calculation:** Length × Width = required claim blocks

### Checking Your Blocks
- `/claimblocks` - See available claim blocks
- `/claimblocks <player>` - Check another player's blocks (if admin)

## 🏗️ Subdivisions

### Creating Subdivisions
Divide large claims into smaller sections:

1. **Stand inside** your existing claim
2. **Use the claim tool** to select subdivision area
3. **Use `/subdivideclaim`** to create the subdivision
4. **Trust different players** to different subdivisions

### Managing Subdivisions
- Each subdivision can have different permissions
- Useful for shared projects or rental properties
- Subdivisions inherit main claim protections

## 🚫 Claim Flags & Settings

### Useful Flags
Customize your claim behavior:

- `/claimflag greeting <message>` - Set welcome message
- `/claimflag farewell <message>` - Set goodbye message
- `/claimflag pvp true/false` - Allow/deny PvP in claim
- `/claimflag explosion true/false` - Allow/deny explosions

### Checking Flags
- `/claimflag` - List all available flags
- `/claimflag <flag>` - Check current setting
