## Building on MCWeb

Whether you're a beginner or an experienced builder, this guide will help you create impressive structures and improve your building skills on our server.

## üèóÔ∏è Getting Started

### Planning Your Build
Before you start placing blocks:

1. **Choose a theme** - Medieval, modern, fantasy, etc.
2. **Sketch your design** - Even a rough drawing helps
3. **Pick a location** - Consider terrain and surroundings
4. **Gather materials** - Plan what blocks you'll need
5. **Claim your area** - Protect your build site

### Essential Building Tools
- **Stone/wooden tools** for basic building
- **Silk touch pickaxe** for collecting decorative blocks
- **Efficiency tools** for faster resource gathering
- **Scaffolding** for vertical construction
- **Shulker boxes** for mobile storage

## üìê Building Fundamentals

### Scale and Proportions
- **Avoid tiny builds** - Make structures at least 5x5
- **Use odd numbers** - 7x9, 11x13 tend to look better
- **Height variation** - Mix tall and short elements
- **Depth is key** - Avoid flat walls

### Color Theory
- **Complementary colors** work well together
- **Use neutral blocks** as a base (stone, wood)
- **Add accent colors** sparingly
- **Consider the environment** - build with the landscape

### Texturing Techniques
- **Mix similar blocks** - cobblestone + stone + andesite
- **Add block variation** - stairs, slabs, walls
- **Use different orientations** - logs, glazed terracotta
- **Include wear and weathering** - mossy blocks, cracked stone
